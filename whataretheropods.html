<h1>What Are Theropods?</h1>

<b>Theropoda means ‘Beast feet’.</b> It was the group in which all carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Velociraptor, etc. belonged to.  This diagram shows a few large theropods.<br>

Theropod dinosaurs, or Theropods, all shared common features like sharp claws and teeth and all were bipedal. They all had four toed feet; three were big and were the toes which the Theropod stood on and the fourth was very small and hung in the air close to the ankle.<br>

Theropods also needed a lot of intelligence and big brains. This is because finding, chasing, and killing an animal took more intelligence than finding and eating a plant, which is all that herbivorous dinosaurs did. However, theropods weren’t REALLY very smart. Even the smartest dinosaur which was a Theropod, Troodon, was only as smart as the dumbest animals today, like opossums.<br><br>
Theropods were also typically faster than other dinosaurs, to hunt and kill. They had strong, slender legs giving them big strides. Their feet had 4 toes; 3 were clawed and touched the ground, supporting the dinosaur’s weight and 1 was tiny and attached near the ankle.<br><br>
However, the facts stated in the above two paragraphs may not be true for all Theropods, because not all Theropods were carnivorous in fact. There was a family of dinosaurs, Therizinosauridae, that was purely herbivorous, and a few other dinosaurs.<br>

The largest Theropod, which is also the largest terrestrial predator that ever existed, is Spinosaurus. The smallest Theropod, which is also the smallest adult dinosaur discovered, is Compsognathus.
