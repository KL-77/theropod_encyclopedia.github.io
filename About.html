<h1>About Theropod Encyclopedia</h1>

<div class = "leftdiv">
<p>
Theropod Encyclopedia is an initiative to bring alive the full glory of the Theropods which, in our opinion, were some of the greatest animals ever to walk the Earth. Every single family and clade under Theropoda is analysed here, with stellar images and cladograms, from wikipedia and other sources (credits are in this page). This site is currently under development at GitHub. (Some chapters are still absent. We apologise for the inconvenience).
