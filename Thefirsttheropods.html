<h1>The First Theropods</h1>

<b>The first Theropods appeared in the Mid Triassic period, about 230 mya. </b>The Permian Mass Extinction allowed them to evolve. However, they were very small, no bigger than 6 feet long. Most were dwarfed by other Archosaurs living in the same habitat, like Archosaurs, Cynodonts, Dicynodonts, Rauisuchians, etc. This is a common Triassic scene.<br>

Eoraptor was one such early Theropod. It was probably the first dinosaur to evolve, and about a meter in length. It preyed on small lizards and other animals. A few other examples are Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus. This is a picture of Eoraptor.<br>

As dinosaurs started to dominate and other types of animals went extinct, predators grew bigger and more advanced. They started to diversify. Soon, Coelophysoids evolved in the Late Triassic.<br>
